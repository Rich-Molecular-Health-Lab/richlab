## To Gather from Video Data {.tabset}
Here are some ideas for variables we could eventually extract from the video behavior files:\

### Both Subjects
- Activity Level\
  - relative time active/inactive\
  - other quantitative score that folds in different activity types\
    
### Culi Only
- Seizures\
  - Seizure Observed by Day/Week\
  - Qualitative metrics to breakdown seizure details/category\

---

# Dependent Variables
Here are some of the dependent variables we can extract from the results:\

## Microbial Abundance
**How we calculated microbial abundance:** Remember that we constructed sequencing libraries that amplified the entire 1500 bp region of the 16S gene for any and all available microbial DNA present in our DNA extracts. 
Then, during sequencing, each available template was sequenced to produce an individual "read". 
Most of the time we sequenced pooled libraries with 23 samples and 1 negative control until we used up all available pores on one Flongle Flow Cell. 
Then we binned all the reads into folders for each sample and matched every read from a sample to all available sequences in our NCBI reference database. 
If a read matched a reference sequence to a minimum threshold, then we assigned that taxonomic identity to the read. 
Then we counted the number of reads assigned to each taxon per sample. 
This result became our raw count data, which we then **rarefied** for **normalization** across all samples.\

### Normalization
There is a complex literature available on all the pros and cons of options for when and how to normalize 16S microbiome data. 
Rarefaction is still the most commonly used option, so that's what we have done here, especially because microeco makes it easy to automate the process. We did, however, apply a [modified version of rarefaction](https://peerj.com/articles/9593/) that is growing in popularity.\
**What rarefaction does**: Our count data for each sample are confounded by variation in the total number of reads we started with for that sample after demultiplexing our libraries. 
To correct for this, we choose a threshold read count as our **rarefaction threshold**. 
Then we only keep samples for which we generated at least that number of reads, and we only keep that number of reads for all samples with more than the threshold.\
**Which reads to keep/lose:** The next issue is how to select which reads to keep and ignore without introducing more bias to our data. We used the microeco option ***SRS***, which performs an alternative rarefaction method by **[scaling with ranked subsampling](https://peerj.com/articles/9593/)**.\
**SRS Steps:**
1. The total counts for all OTUs (operational taxonomic units) or species in each sample are divided by a scaling factor chosen in such a way that the sum of the scaled counts Cscaled equals Cmin.\
2. The non-integer Cscaled values are converted into integers by an algorithm known as *ranked subsampling*.\

#### Our Rarefaction Threshold
For now, we used 7,000 as our threshold. 
I did this based on some of the early rarefaction curves coming out of the data, and because the standard in traditional short read 16S data is often somewhere between 6K and 12K reads. 
Nanopore sequencing generates fewer relative reads, especially when we multiplex on a flongle flow cell, so we could reconsider using a lower rarefaction threshold once we have more data and look at the trends again. 
The trick is to balance the tradeoff between not losing too much detail in our low-abundance taxa by choosing too low of a read count and not losing too much detail from our sample sizes by choosing too high of a read count.\

### Filtering
We already filtered reads during our earlier pipelines based on their length and quality, but then we filtered taxa again to minimize the confounding impacts of taxa with very few representative reads in our data.\
This is fairly standard practice, as low abundance taxa across all samples are more likely to appear as a result of false taxonomic assignment, especially with increasing sample sizes or sequencing depths.\
I started with very generous filtering thresholds as we were looking for subtle patterns with a very small subset of our total samples, 
but over time I have incrementally adjusted this to get a clearer picture of the key patterns in our data.\
**Right now we are filtering out:**\
1. Taxa with abundances less than **0.01%**.\
2. Taxa present in fewer than **2.00%** of all samples.\

### Taxonomic Levels
Analyzing the entire 16S gene through long read sequencing affords us a finer taxonomic resolution than traditional analysis of a hypervariable region of the 16S gene through short read sequencing. 
That means we can safely analyze our abundances to as fine as the Species level.\
Still, sometimes trends at the higher taxonomic scales are still more informative, depending on the question. 
The microeco package makes it pretty easy to merge abundance data to a given higher taxonomic level after we construct our microbiome dataset object and normalize/filter the reads and taxa. 
That is why I generally just compute our basic abundance summary statistics at each of the following levels:\
  1. Phylum\
  2. Class\
  3. Order\
  4. Family\
  5. Genus\
  6. Species\
After performing some other calculations like correlation coefficients, I merged those taxonomic scales back into our summary tables/figures for ease of comparison. 
We should still take care to keep in mind that the stats we are looking at were computed individually at each taxonomic level.\

## Alpha Diversity {.tabset}
Alpha diversity measures the overall taxonomic diversity within each sample. We have already generated the following Alpha Diversity metrics:\

### Chao1
- estimator of species richness, which corrects for species that might be present but not detected in your sample due to low abundance\
- assumes that:\
  - rare species are more likely to be missed during sampling\
- useful for:\
  - low abundances\
  - rare or hard to detect taxa\
  
### ACE
*Abundance-based Coverage Estimator*\
- estimates species richness by dividing observed frequencies into rare and abundant groups, and then considering only the presence or absence of abundant species.\
- what it indicates:\
  - Higher ACE values indicate higher diversity. ACE is sensitive to rare OTUs (singletons and doubletons)\
- useful for:\
  - SSU rRNA like 16S\
- do not use with:\
  - estimating total richness of amplicon sequence variant (ASV) datasets like we might get from shotgun short read sequencing\
  
### Shannon
- measures the number of species in a sample and how evenly their abundances are distributed\
- what it indicates:\
  - A higher Shannon Index value indicates a higher degree of diversity, which can be due to a greater number of unique taxa or more even abundance distributions\
  - Higher values indicate higher diversity, and the maximum value is achieved when all species are present in equal numbers.\
- useful for:\
  - can help understand the complexity and balance of the gut microbiome\
  
### Simpson
- an indicator of species evenness (proportional distribution of the number of each species in a sample) that displays the probability that two randomly selected sequences are of the same species.\
- what it indicates:\
  - Values range from 0 to 1, and lower values indicate higher diversity.\
  
### Inverse Simpson
- a measure of the effective number of equally common species in a dataset\
- what it indicates:\
  - the richness of a community with uniform evenness\
  - it measures the number of equally common species that would produce the observed Simpson's index value\
  - higher values = more equally abundant individuals and higher evenness\
  - values approaching 1 = a single dominant species is influencing the calculations\
- advantages:\
  - it has some biological interpretation and is not as affected by sampling effort as the Shannon index\
  
### Fisher
- a diversity index commonly used in ecology to quantify species diversity within a community\
- takes into account:\
  - species richness and evenness\
- useful for:\
  - data where species-abundance distribution follows a log-series distribution.\
  
### Pielou
- a way to measure how the species are evenly distributed in a community\
- values range between 0 and 1:\
  - 1 = community with perfect evenness\
  - approaching 0 = the relative abundances of the species diverge from evenness.\

---

## Beta Diversity
Beta diversity measures the dissimilarity in composition between samples.\

### Matrix Calculations {.tabset}
Before we map betadiversity patterns using the methods in the next section, we have to calculate a distance matrix that provides the dissimilarity index for each pair of samples. Within MicroEco we can use the following metrics to calculate the matrix:\

#### Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity

##### Description
This is one of the most commonly used dissimilarity indices in ecological studies. It calculates the dissimilarity between two samples based on the abundance of shared species (or taxa).\

##### Focus
Takes into account both the presence/absence and abundance of taxa.\

##### Range
0 (identical communities) to 1 (completely different communities).\

##### Recommended for
Quantifying differences in community composition when you are interested in both the presence and relative abundance of taxa.\

#### Jaccard Index

##### Description
This index calculates dissimilarity based solely on the presence or absence of taxa between two samples.\

###### Focus
Measures community dissimilarity based on species (taxa) presence/absence.\

##### Range
0 (identical communities in terms of presence/absence) to 1 (no shared species between communities).\

##### Recommended for
Cases where you are only interested in the presence or absence of taxa, and not their abundance.\

---

#### UniFrac (Unweighted and Weighted)

##### Description
UniFrac distances are phylogenetic metrics that measure the dissimilarity between microbial communities based on the evolutionary distances between taxa.\
- **Unweighted UniFrac**: Focuses on the presence or absence of taxa, considering phylogenetic relationships.\
- **Weighted UniFrac**: Incorporates both phylogenetic relationships and the abundance of taxa in the communities.\

##### Focus
Phylogenetic diversity; unweighted focuses on presence/absence, while weighted takes abundance into account.\

##### Range
0 (identical communities with no evolutionary difference) to 1 (completely different communities).\

##### Recommended for
When evolutionary relationships between microbial taxa are important in determining community dissimilarity.\

---

#### Canberra Distance

##### Description
Canberra distance is a dissimilarity measure that gives more weight to differences in low-abundance taxa than high-abundance taxa. It is sensitive to small differences in the relative abundance of species.\

##### Focus
More sensitive to the abundance of rare taxa.\

##### Range
0 (identical communities) to 1 (completely different communities).\

##### Recommended for
When small differences in the abundance of rare taxa are of particular interest.\

---

#### Euclidean Distance

##### Description
Euclidean distance is a straight-line measure between two points in a multidimensional space (here, representing microbial abundances).\

##### Focus
Measures absolute differences in taxa abundances between samples.\

##### Range
0 (identical communities) to a positive value, depending on the magnitude of difference.\

##### Recommended for
Basic comparison of absolute differences in community composition, though it’s less commonly used in ecological contexts due to its sensitivity to large differences.\

---

#### Aitchison Distance

##### Description
Aitchison distance is used specifically for compositional data, where relative abundances matter more than absolute counts. It is based on log-ratio transformations.\

##### Focus
Appropriate for comparing compositional data (relative abundances) while avoiding issues related to the "compositional nature" of microbiome data (e.g., total sum constraint).\

##### Range
Positive values, where larger values indicate greater dissimilarity.\

##### Recommended for
When analyzing microbial community compositions, especially when addressing issues like compositionality in microbiome data.\

---

#### Sorensen (Dice) Index

##### Description
This index is similar to the Jaccard index but gives more weight to shared species (taxa). It measures the proportion of shared taxa between two samples.\

##### Focus
Presence/absence data, but more sensitive to shared taxa than Jaccard.\

##### Range
0 (completely similar) to 1 (completely dissimilar).\

##### Recommended for
Assessing beta diversity based on the presence/absence of taxa, giving more weight to shared taxa.\

---

#### Chao Distance

##### Description
Chao distance is an abundance-based metric that adjusts for unseen species by estimating how many rare or unseen taxa are likely shared between samples.\

##### Focus
Accounts for unseen or rare taxa, improving the comparison of samples with low-abundance taxa.\

##### Range
0 (identical communities) to 1 (completely different communities).\

##### Recommended for
When dealing with datasets where rare or unobserved taxa might skew results.\

---

#### Gower Distance

##### Description
Gower distance is a flexible metric that can handle different types of data (e.g., categorical and continuous variables). For microbiome data, it’s often used for combining different types of diversity measures.\

##### Focus
Measures similarity between samples while accounting for multiple types of data or weighting schemes.\

##### Range
0 (complete similarity) to 1 (complete dissimilarity).\

##### Recommended for
When you need a flexible approach to handling multiple types of data within the same matrix.\

### Distrubtion Metrics  {.tabset}
#### Ordination
**Ordination** methods are dimensionality reduction techniques that reduce complex data (e.g., community composition across multiple samples) into fewer dimensions for visualization and interpretation. These techniques can highlight patterns of similarity or difference between samples.\
- Options in microeco: \
  - **Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA)**\
  - **Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS)**\
  - **Redundancy Analysis (RDA)**\
- How it works: \
  - Ordination projects data points (samples) onto a low-dimensional space where the distance between points reflects the dissimilarity between the corresponding microbial communities. \
  - It is often based on distance or dissimilarity matrices calculated using methods like Bray-Curtis or Jaccard.\
- Purpose: \
  - Visualizing the overall structure of microbial communities and identifying potential clusters or gradients in the data.\

#### Group Distance
**Group distance** metrics calculate and compare the distances between groups of samples. This allows for the quantification of the beta diversity between predefined groups (e.g., treatment vs. control, or different geographic locations).\
- Options in microeco: \
  - **PERMANOVA (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance)**\
  - **ADONIS (a function within PERMANOVA)**\
- How it works: \
  - The distance between groups of samples is calculated using dissimilarity measures like Bray-Curtis or UniFrac.\
  - Statistical tests like PERMANOVA then compare the distances between groups to assess whether there is a significant difference in the microbial community structure between them.\
- Purpose: \
  - Testing hypotheses about the influence of environmental factors, treatments, or other variables on microbiome composition.\

#### Clustering
**Clustering methods** group samples together based on their similarities in microbial composition, forming clusters that represent similar microbial communities.\
- Options in microeco: \
  - **Hierarchical clustering**\
  - **k-means clustering**\
- How it works: \
  - Clustering algorithms group samples based on a distance or dissimilarity matrix.\
  - In hierarchical clustering, for example, the most similar samples are joined together first, and the process continues until all samples are clustered into a dendrogram.\
- Purpose: \
  - This helps to categorize samples into clusters of similar microbial composition and visualize patterns of beta diversity across the dataset.\

#### MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance)
**MANOVA** is a statistical test that evaluates whether there are differences in the means of several dependent variables (e.g., microbial taxa) between different groups (e.g., treatment groups, environmental conditions).\
- Options in microeco: \
  - Multivariate tests like MANOVA can be applied to the compositional data to test for group-level differences.\
- How it works: \
  - MANOVA assesses multiple response variables simultaneously (e.g., microbial taxa abundances) across different groups (e.g., sample types).\
  - It tests whether the centroid (mean) of microbial community composition differs significantly across the groups.\
- Purpose: \
  - It is used to test hypotheses regarding how different factors (like environmental conditions or treatments) impact microbial communities as a whole, accounting for the correlations between different taxa or features.\
