  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Blood-feeding insects are important vectors for an
                  array of zoonotic pathogens. While previous efforts toward
                  generating molecular resources have largely focused on major
                  vectors of global medical and veterinary importance, molecular
                  data across a large number of hematophagous insect taxa remain
                  limited. Advancements in long-read sequencing technologies and
                  associated bioinformatic pipelines provide new opportunities
                  for targeted sequencing of insect mitochondrial (mt) genomes.
                  For engorged hematophagous insects, such technologies can be
                  leveraged for both insect mitogenome genome assembly and
                  identification of vertebrate blood-meal sources. METHODS: We
                  used nanopore adaptive sampling (NAS) to sequence genomic DNA
                  from four species of field-collected, blood-engorged
                  mosquitoes (Aedes and Culex spp.) and one deer fly (Chrysops
                  sp.). NAS was used for bioinformatical enrichment of mtDNA
                  reads of hematophagous insects and potential vertebrate
                  blood-meal hosts using publically available mt genomes as
                  references. We also performed an experimental control to
                  compare results of traditional non-NAS nanopore sequencing to
                  the mt genome enrichment by the NAS method. RESULTS: Complete
                  mitogenomes were assembled and annotated for all five species
                  sequenced with NAS: Aedes trivittatus, Aedes vexans, Culex
                  restuans, Culex territans and the deer fly, Chrysops niger. In
                  comparison to data generated during our non-NAS control
                  experiment, NAS yielded a substantially higher proportion of
                  reference-mapped mtDNA reads, greatly streamlining downstream
                  mitogenome assembly and annotation. The NAS-assembled
                  mitogenomes ranged in length from 15,582 to 16,045 bp,
                  contained between 78.1\% and 79.0\% A + T content and shared
                  the anticipated arrangement of 13 protein-coding genes, two
                  ribosomal RNAs, and 22 transfer RNAs. Maximum likelihood
                  phylogenies were generated to further characterize each insect
                  species. Additionally, vertebrate blood-meal analysis was
                  successful in three samples sequenced, with mtDNA-based
                  phylogenetic analyses revealing that blood-meal sources for
                  Chrysops niger, Culex restuans and Aedes trivittatus were
                  human, house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and eastern
                  cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), respectively.
                  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that NAS has dual utility to
                  simultaneously molecularly identify hematophagous insects and
                  their blood-meal hosts. Moreover, our data indicate NAS can
                  facilitate a wide array of mitogenomic systematic studies
                  through novel 'phylogenetic capture' methods. We conclude that
                  the NAS approach has great potential for broadly improving
                  genomic resources used to identify blood-feeding insects,
                  answer phylogenetic questions and elucidate complex pathways
                  for the transmission of vector-borne pathogens.},

                  enrichment unique to nanopore sequencing platforms. To test
                  its potential for enrichment of rarer species within
                  metagenomic samples, we create a synthetic mock community and
                  construct sequencing libraries with a range of mean read
                  lengths. Enrichment is up to 13.87-fold for the least abundant
                  species in the longest read length library; factoring in
                  reduced yields from rejecting molecules the calculated
                  efficiency raises this to 4.93-fold. Finally, we introduce a
                  mathematical model of enrichment based on molecule length and
                  relative abundance, whose predictions correlate strongly with
                  mock and complex real-world microbial communities.},
