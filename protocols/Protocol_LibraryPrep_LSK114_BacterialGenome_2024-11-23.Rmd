## Prepare the NEB reagents in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions, and place on ice.

#.    Thaw all reagents on ice.
#.    Flick and/or invert the reagent tubes to ensure they are well mixed.
  +   Note: Do not vortex the FFPE DNA Repair Mix or Ultra II End Prep Enzyme Mix.
  +   Always spin down tubes before opening for the first time each day.
#.   Vortex the FFPE DNA Repair Buffer v2, or the NEBNext FFPE DNA Repair Buffer and Ultra II End Prep Reaction Buffer to ensure they are well mixed.
  +   Note: These buffers may contain a white precipitate. If this occurs, allow the mixture(s) to come to room temperature and pipette the buffer several times to break up the precipitate, followed by a quick vortex to mix.
  +   The FFPE DNA Repair Buffer may have a yellow tinge and is fine to use if yellow.

## Prepare the DNA in nuclease-free water:

#. Transfer 1 μg (or 100-200 fmol) input DNA into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf DNA LoBind tube.
#. Adjust the volume to 47 μl with nuclease-free water.
#. Mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down, or by flicking the tube
#. Spin down briefly in a microfuge.

## Prepare the Clean-Up Reaction

#. Resuspend the AMPure XP Beads (AXP) by vortexing.
#. Add 40 µl of resuspended AMPure XP Beads (AXP) to the reaction and mix by flicking the tube.
#. Incubate on a Hula mixer (rotator mixer) for 5 minutes at room temperature.
#. Spin down the sample and pellet on a magnet. Keep the tube on the magnet, and pipette off the supernatant when clear and colourless.
#. Wash the beads by adding either 250 μl Long Fragment Buffer (LFB) or 250 μl Short Fragment Buffer (SFB). Flick the beads to resuspend, spin down, then return the tube to the magnetic rack and allow the beads to pellet. Remove the supernatant using a pipette and discard.
#. Repeat the previous step.
#. Spin down and place the tube back on the magnet. Pipette off any residual supernatant. Allow to dry for \~30 seconds, but do not dry the pellet to the point of cracking.
#. Remove the tube from the magnetic rack and resuspend the pellet in 15 µl Elution Buffer (EB). 
  +   Spin down and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. 
  +   For high molecular weight DNA, incubating at 37°C can improve the recovery of long fragments.
#. Pellet the beads on a magnet until the eluate is clear and colourless, for at least 1 minute.
#. Remove and retain 15 µl of eluate containing the DNA library into a clean 1.5 ml Eppendorf DNA LoBind tube.
  +   Dispose of the pelleted beads
#. Quantify 1 µl of eluted sample using a Qubit fluorometer.
#. Depending on your DNA library fragment size, prepare your final library in 12 µl of Elution Buffer (EB).

#. Open the MinION device lid and slide the flow cell under the clip. ![Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_1a](attachments/Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_1a.svg)

#. Press down firmly on the flow cell to ensure correct thermal and electrical contact. ![Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_1b](attachments/Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_1b.svg)
#. Slide the flow cell priming port cover clockwise to open the priming port.
  +   Take care when drawing back buffer from the flow cell.
  +   Do not remove more than 20-30 µl, and make sure that the array of pores are covered by buffer at all times.
  +   Introducing air bubbles into the array can irreversibly damage pores.
#. After opening the priming port, check for a small air bubble under the cover. Draw back a small volume to remove any bubbles
  +   Set a P1000 pipette to 200 µl ![Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_2](attachments/Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_2.svg)
  +   Insert the tip into the priming port
  +   Turn the wheel until the dial shows 220-230 µl, to draw back 20-30 µl, or until you can see a small volume of buffer entering the pipette tip
    -   Note: Visually check that there is continuous buffer from the priming port across the sensor array. ![Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_03_V5](attachments/Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_03_V5.gif)
      -   Continuous buffer: Visually inspect the sample port, inlet channel and sensor array to make sure the buffer is continuous and no significant air bubbles are present.
        -   Air bubbles may develop under the sample port cover.
        -   If any air bubble is present, using a Gilson P1000 pipette gently draw back the air bubble into the tip.
        -   Only a few microlitres should be removed, and the sensor array and inlet channel should have buffer across them at all times.
        -   There is a small excess of buffer in the flow cell to allow for this process, but beware of drawing back too much.
#. Load 800 µl of the priming mix into the flow cell via the priming port, avoiding the introduction of air bubbles.
  +   Wait for five minutes.
  +   During this time, prepare the library for loading by following the steps below. ![Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_04_V5](attachments/Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_04_V5.gif)

#. Thoroughly mix the contents of the Library Beads (LIB) by pipetting.
#. Complete the flow cell priming:
  +   Gently lift the SpotON sample port cover to make the SpotON sample port accessible.
  +   Load 200 µl of the priming mix into the flow cell priming port (not the SpotON sample port), avoiding the introduction of air bubbles. ![Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_04_V5](attachments/Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_04_V5.gif) ![Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_5](attachments/Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_5.svg)
#. Mix the prepared library gently by pipetting up and down just prior to loading.
#. Add 75 μl of the prepared library to the flow cell via the SpotON sample port in a dropwise fashion. Ensure each drop flows into the port before adding the next. ![Flow Cell Loading Diagrams Step 06 V5](attachments/Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_06_V5.gif) ![Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_07_V5](attachments/Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_07_V5.gif)
#. Gently replace the SpotON sample port cover, making sure the bung enters the SpotON port and close the priming port. ![Flow Cell Loading Diagram Step 8](attachments/Step_8_update.png) ![Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_9](attachments/Flow_Cell_Loading_Diagrams_Step_9.svg)
  +   Install the light shield on your flow cell as soon as library has been loaded for optimal sequencing output.
    +   ONT recommends leaving the light shield on the flow cell when library is loaded, including during any washing and reloading steps.
    +   The shield can be removed when the library has been removed from the flow cell.
#. Place the light shield onto the flow cell, as follows:
  +   Carefully place the leading edge of the light shield against the clip.
    -   Note: Do not force the light shield underneath the clip.
  +   Gently lower the light shield onto the flow cell.
    -   The light shield should sit around the SpotON cover, covering the entire top section of the flow cell. [Light_shield_animation_Flow_Cell](attachments/J2264_-_Light_shield_animation_Flow_Cell_FAW_optimised.gif)
  +   The MinION Flow Cell Light Shield is not secured to the flow cell and careful handling is required after installation.
  
## Close the device lid and set up a sequencing run on MinKNOW.
